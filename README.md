Home automation framework, written in Go

This project has a *long* way to go.  The basic idea is to create a "ifthisthenthat" style home automation server, running on a Raspberry Pi3, with a lovely, fluffy web interface to say things like "if I enter the house, turn the hallway light on".  I am planning to use Onion Omega as the client end points, using HTTP as the interconnect and maybe broadcast as an emergency shut down.
